;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a NTLM handler for the URL package.
;; It supports one username and password per server.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add the directory containing this file to the load path and then load the url-http-ntlm
;; package. One way would be to add something like the lines below to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path ".emacs.d/url-http-ntlm")
;; (require 'url-http-ntlm)
;;
;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; Taro Kawagishi <tarok@transpulse.org> wrote ntlm.el and md4.el, which are parts of FLIM
;; (Faithful Library about Internet Message).
